# Natural Language AI

Natural Language AI is Google Cloud's suite of natural language understanding (NLU) services that use machine learning to reveal the structure and meaning of text. It provides pre-trained models via API, allowing developers to analyze sentiment, extract entities, classify content, and understand the syntactic structure of text without having to build their own NLP models.

## Key Features

- **Entity Analysis**: Extract entities (people, places, things)
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Determine text sentiment (positive/negative)
- **Entity Sentiment Analysis**: Sentiment specific to entities
- **Content Classification**: Categorize text into topics
- **Syntax Analysis**: Parse grammatical structure of text
- **Text Moderation**: Identify offensive content
- **Document Analysis**: Analyze document structure and content
- **Custom Entity Extraction**: Define custom entity types
- **Multiple Languages**: Support for multiple languages
- **AutoML Natural Language**: Create custom NLP models
- **Batch Processing**: Analyze multiple documents
- **Integrated with Vertex AI**: Part of Google's AI platform
